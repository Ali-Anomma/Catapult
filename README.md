# Catapult

**Catapult** is a cross-platform launcher and content manager for [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA) and [Cataclysm: Bright Nights](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN). It is made with the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine and in part inspired by earlier versions of [RÃ©my Roy's launcher](https://github.com/remyroy/CDDA-Game-Launcher).

## Features

- Automatic game download and installation (stable or experimental releases).
- Updating the game while preserving user data (saved games, settings, mods, etc).
- Mod management: Kenan Modpack download and complete or selective installation.
- Automatic download and installation of soundpacks.
- Good support for HiDPI displays: UI is automatically scaled with screen DPI, with ability to adjust the scale manually.

## Installation

None required. The launcher is a single, self-contained executable. Just [download](https://github.com/qrrk/Catapult/releases) it to a separate folder and run!

## System requirements

- OS: Windows 7+ or Linux, 64 bit.
- OpenGL 2.1 support.

## Future plans

These are tentative. They may or may not come to fruition.

- Backups for savegames, settings, maybe the whole game.
  (Backing up at least the current installation before updating will be a good failsafe.)
- Multiple UI themes (with at least one light theme).
- Download and installation of tilesets?
  (Only if there are at least a couple of finished tilesets out there that don't already come with both games.)
- *Maybe* an OSX version some day.
  (The main obstacle here is that I don't have a Mac and don't want one for anything other than this project. However, the amount of porting work should be minimal, so maybe I can get an IRL buddy to help me.)
